Concentration Card Game Rules

Concentration is a card game where all of the cards are shuffled and are laid face down on a surface in orderly rows and columns.

All of the cards must have a mate (pairs).

Each turn, two cards are flipped over.  If the cards do not match, they are both turned back face down.  If the cards match, they are left face up and the person who made the match receives a point.

With a regular deck of cards, the pair is considered the card with the same color and number (so the ace of hearts matches the ace of diamonds).

Concentration can be played with regular playing cards or with special themed cards.  It can be played by 1, 2, 3 or 4 people.  More than 4 people can be divided into teams.
